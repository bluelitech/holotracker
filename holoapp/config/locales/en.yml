        title: "Method of Acquiring Subscriber Counts"
        text1: "The subscriber count of a channel is obtained by using the YouTube Data API v3, where data is collected at regular intervals and the daily changes are displayed as the difference between the latest acquisition time and the subscriber count 24 hours prior."
        text2: "The frequency of data collection changes depending on the situation, but the basic interval is once every 10 minutes."
        text3: "Please note that due to the API specifications, the channel subscriber count is only reflected when there are increases or decreases by units of 1,000 for counts under 1 million subscribers, and by units of 10,000 for counts over 1 million subscribers."
        text4: "As a result, even if the actual number of subscribers has increased, it is counted as 0 unless the increase exceeds 1,000 (or 10,000) subscribers."
