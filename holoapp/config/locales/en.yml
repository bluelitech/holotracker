        body:
          text1: Target data for analysis
          text2: Around the debut date of members, the increase in the number of channel subscribers is notable, while on the other hand, it can significantly decrease due to account bans by YouTube.
          text3: Such data can greatly impact the forecast, so we only target the number of channel subscribers one month after the debut of the members.
          text4: Forecast method
          text5: We use the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) to predict the transition of the number of channel subscribers over the next three years.
          text6: Forecast results
          text7: Million forecast
          text8: We were able to predict the next million (in units of 1 million) for the members.
          text9: Round forecast
          text10: Although we were unable to predict the next million for the members, we were able to predict the rounded number (in units of 100,000).
          text11: Forecast failure
          text12: Failed on both the million forecast and the rounded number forecast.
          text13: Insufficient data
          text14: There is insufficient data to analyze, such as immediately after debut.
          text15: Notes
          text16: Please note that the dates that are calculated as the anticipated achievement dates are merely forecasts, and the actual achievement dates may vary*¬π.
          text17: The number of channel subscribers is updated approximately every 10 minutes, but it takes time to reflect this because the million forecast recalculates the anticipated achievement date and time only once a day.
          text18: "*¬π: Because members often do endurance streaming around milestones in the number of channel subscribers (generally in units of 100,000), they tend to achieve these earlier than the predicted achievement dates."

        text1: "The subscriber count of a channel is obtained by using the YouTube Data API v3, where data is collected at regular intervals and the daily changes are displayed as the difference between the latest acquisition time and the subscriber count 24 hours prior."
        text2: "The frequency of data collection changes depending on the situation, but the basic interval is once every 10 minutes."
        text3: "Please note that due to the API specifications, the channel subscriber count is only reflected when there are increases or decreases by units of 1,000 for counts under 1 million subscribers, and by units of 10,000 for counts over 1 million subscribers."
        text4: "As a result, even if the actual number of subscribers has increased, it is counted as 0 unless the increase exceeds 1,000 (or 10,000) subscribers."
